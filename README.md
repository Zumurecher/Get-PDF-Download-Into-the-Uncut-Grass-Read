Book Descriptions:
A story for all ages from the author of the #1 bestselling Born a Crime

“But sooner or later your mother will find us,” Walter said, looking back at the house. “She always does.”

The boy’s eyes lit up again. He had an idea.

“Then this time we need to go where we’ve never gone before,” he said. “Into the uncut grass!”

In the tradition of The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse comes a gorgeously illustrated fable about a young child’s journey into the world beyond the shadow of home, a magical landscape where he discovers the secrets of sharing, connection, and finding peace with the people we love. Infused with the author’s signature wit and imagination, in collaboration with visionary artist Sabina Hahn, it’s a tale for readers of all ages—to be read aloud or read alone..
